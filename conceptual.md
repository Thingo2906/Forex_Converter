### Conceptual Exercise ###

## Answer the following questions below:

* What are important differences between Python and JavaScript?
*We use JavaScript for client-side, and use Python for the service-side.*

# Given a dictionary like ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}``: , list two ways you can try to get a missing key (like "c") without your programming crashing.

*Method1: We use get(x, default) function to return the default value for the key "c".*
    print({"a": 1, "b": 2}.get("c", 3)) //3"

*Method2_: Adding the value for c, so the dictionary will get new key_value and add it at the end of itself*
     {"a": 1, "b" : 2}["c"]= 3;
